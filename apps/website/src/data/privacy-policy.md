- ### Analytics

  The services contained in this section enable the Owner to monitor and analyze web traffic and can be used to keep track of User behavior.

  #### Vercel Web Analytics

  This website utilizes Vercel Web Analytics to measure views. Vercel Web Analytics is designed to align with
  international data protection guidelines. It does not collect personal identifiers that track and cross-check
  users' data across different applications or websites. The service deals with only aggregated data which does not
  allow identification or re-identification of end users.
  Data points like page views and custom events are recorded anonymously. They are not tied or associated with any
  individual, customer, or IP address. Moreover, Vercel Web Analytics does not collect or store any information that
  could reconstruct a user’s browsing session across different applications or websites, or personally identify a user.
  A minimal amount of data is collected for aggregated statistics only.
  Full list of data points: Timestamp of event, URL, referrer, rough location (country, region and city) derived from
  the visitor’s IP address, name and version of the web browser, name and version of the operating system,
  and device category (desktop, mobile or tablet).

- ### Measuring views (Plausible Analytics)

  To measure views on this website we use the open-source software Plausible Analytics. We minimizes data collection in general and whatever we track is
  kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on a server controlled by Alveus Sanctuary in the European Union to ensure it is being covered by the strict
  laws on data privacy.  We do not use cookies and do not generate any persistent identifiers for the purpose of measuring view.
  Plausible Analytics generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitors on a website and reset this string once per day.
  All the data is isolated to a single day only, therefore, there is no way to know whether a person comes back to a site on another day.
  All site measurements are carried out anonymously. Plausible Analytics measures only the most essential data points and nothing else.
  We collect the pages that get viewed, the referrers that link to this website, name and version of the web browser, name and version of the operating system,
  device category (desktop, mobile or tablet) and a rough location (country, region and city) derived from the visitor’s IP address.
  We do not attempt to generate a device-persistent identifier which would be considered personal data under GDPR.
  We do not use cookies, browser cache nor the local storage. Using Plausible Analytics we generate a daily changing identifier
  using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent. To anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, Plausible Analytics
  runs them through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitor
  numbers for the day. The raw data IP address and User-Agent are not stored in our databases or anywhere on disk at all. Old salts are deleted every 24
  hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.

  Personal Data collected: Derived, aggregated and anonymized usage data as described above.
