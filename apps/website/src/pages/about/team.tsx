          Ellie received her PhD from Stanford University in the Biology
          Department in 2021 where she used genomics to study big cats and built
          tools to assist in tracking and identifying illegally traded animals
          and animal products. She is now a post-doctoral fellow with the
          Washington Research Foundation at Washington State University, where
          she has expanded this work to grizzly bears and other Pacific
          Northwest fauna.

          subsequently obtained a M.S. from the University of Hawaii, Hilo.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to her work in genetics, Ellie is also a board member and
          science advisor for Tigers in America and is passionate about working
          to end unregulated captive breeding in the United States.

          Sebastian is a spider scientist, wildlife photographer, and educator
          who loves introducing people to wonderfully weird animals. He&apos;s
          been featured on podcasts, news, and TV, including Ologies, NPR, and
          Disney+. Sebastian studies the evolutionary relationship between
          animals&apos; eyes, their environment, and how they use color, shape,
          and movement to talk with each other. For his PhD, he studied why and
          how jumping spiders get their audience&apos;s attention when
          performing their spectacular courtship dances. Currently, he is
          researching the evolution of eye size across tarantulas. To learn more
          about his work, visit www.spiderdaynightlive.com. Sebastian advises
          Alveus on the care and behavior of the sanctuary&apos;s arthropod
          ambassadors.
