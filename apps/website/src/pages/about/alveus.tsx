          <p className="text-lg">
            Alveus is a nonprofit organization founded by Maya Higa that
            functions as a wildlife sanctuary and as a virtual education center
            facility to provide permanent homes to non-releasable animal
            ambassadors.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg">
            We aim to spread conservation awareness and education to the next
            generation through harnessing the power of online platforms, such as
            Twitch, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. We are committed to
            delivering high-quality, curated and well-researched educational
            content that tells a story, through series such as Animal Quest, and
            through collaborations with other creators.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg">
            Viewers can also follow along with our ambassadors and their daily
            lives at the sanctuary, fostering a deeper connection between our
            audience, the ambassadors, and the species they represent, while
            learning about the conservation stories for each of them. Each and
            every ambassador at Alveus plays an important role as a
            representative of their species, sharing unique stories about
            conservation and consumer choice.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg">
            Our goal is to inspire online audiences across the world to get
            involved with conservation efforts. We hope to create more awareness
            for the diverse planet we live on, and to encourage people to take
            action to protect it, with every individual being able to make a
            difference.
