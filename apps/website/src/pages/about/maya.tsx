              rising star on YouTube. Her passions include wildlife conservation
              and education, and she integrates these into her content
              regularly, creating some of the most unique content on Twitch.

              livestreams feature falconry, wildlife rehab, conservation
              education, and charity fundraising. She created a conservation
              podcast in 2019 which has since aired more than 60 episodes on her

              organizations around the globe. Maya founded Alveus Sanctuary, a
              non-profit wildlife sanctuary and virtual education center in
              central Texas and raised more than $500,000 during her first
              fundraising stream thanks to her amazing community and fellow
