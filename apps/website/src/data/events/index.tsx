            Summer Camp 2024 was a 12-hour-long event with a variety of
            activities that the staff at Alveus participated in. Hosted in and
            around the Session Yard at Alveus, the team had a water balloon
            catapult war, played a game of human battleships, went hunting for
            bugs around the property, had a campfire cookout, and more, all
            streamed live for viewers to watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, as part of Summer Camp, limited-time merch was available
            for viewers to purchase &mdash; a hoodie or pajama pants. Viewers
            were also able gift pre-paid merch to the livestream chat where
            another random viewer would be picked to win it. Each merch purchase
            or gift also came with a signed postcard from the event, and an
            entry into the giveaways. Throughout the event giveaways were run
            for unique items from Summer Camp, with each merch item purchased or
            gifted giving that viewer an entry to win. By the end of the event
            17 bits of Summer Camp history had been given away and 1,280
            postcards had been sent out to viewers who purchased or gifted
            merch. Thank you to everyone that supported Alveus by watching the
            stream or checking out the merch!

            Hosted in the Session Yard at Alveus once again, the annual Art
            Auction returned and was a great success. 35 unique paintings

            for auction, with livestream viewers able to bid on them. Viewers
            could also participate in the fundraising by donating $25 or more to

            Celebrating Valentine&apos;s Day once again, live viewers joined us
            for a short fundraising stream. They were able to donate $25 or more
            to get a signed postcard with artwork featuring the ambassadors to
            commemorate the event, and an entry into the raffle. During the
            event, we were able to raise $32,697 for the sanctuary, with 467
            postcards sent out to donors. The top 3 donors during the event were
            able to pick the plushie they would like, and the remaining 15
            plushies, all handcrafted by Maya, were distributed to random raffle
            winners from those who donated $25 or more.

            ambassadors as we headed around the property to distribute
            Valentine&apos;s-themed enrichment (crafted items to help encourage
            natural behaviors like foraging) to them. Thanks to everyone who

            A fun-filled event at Alveus Sanctuary, where live viewers on the
            stream could compete against each other and ambassadors at Alveus to
            earn virtual points. To help raise funds for Alveus, any donation
            over $25 would get a signed ticket sent to them, and any donation
            over $250 would get a signed polaroid of one of the ambassadors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Live viewers could earn points in a variety of events, including a
            rat maze with riddles to solve in each room as the ambassadors
            explored the maze, ring toss with{" "}

            out numbers.

            By the end of the 3-hour-long event, we were able to raise $16,057

            the donors and 36 ambassador polaroids being sent out to those that

            A 24-hour-long livestream event, featuring many of the Alveus staff
            camping in the Session Yard at Alveus. There were plenty of
            activities for the staff to participate in, including an archery
            competition to start the event off, a water balloon fight later in
            the day, cooking dinner around a campfire, late-night beer pong and
            feeding the pasture with a catapult.
          </p>
          <p>
            After camping overnight, still on the stream, the event ended with a
            craft auction where viewers could bid and donate on 16 different
            crafts made by the staff for the event, including multiple
            friendship bracelets, two different Summer Camp paintings, a few
            ambassador-themed hats, two handcrafted pet rocks, a rubber chicken
            and the Summer Camp Spirit Stick itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the 24-hour stream, a total of $14,070 was raised
            for Alveus Sanctuary, with $6,291 of that coming from the craft
            auction. Thank you to everyone that watched the stream, and to
            everyone that donated to support the sanctuary!

            The Halloween event at Alveus was a massive success, with 34
            creators from across the streaming space descending on the sanctuary
            to help raise money for the animals. During the event, anyone that
            donated $250 or more had their name written on the side wall of the
            Nutrition House, with the wall being sealed after the event. Over
            the evening, 5 hours of live content, we were able to raise $101,971
            for Alveus Sanctuary, with 1,235 donors claiming a name on the wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two teams were formed from the creators, and they competed in many
            activities around the property throughout the event. A game of apple
            bobbing started the evening off, followed by hale bale throwing to
            see which team had better technique. A little while later, we had a
            game of badminton on the grass, followed by trivia and then the dunk
            tank. We rounded off the evening with some mud wrestling. Thank you
            to all the creators that joined us, and everyone who watched and
            donated!

          The event that started it all! A 20-hour-long mega-stream with a bunch
          of donation goals along the way, aiming to raise as much money as
          possible to kick-start Alveus. Each donor that donated $100 or more
          got their name engraved on a golden leaf that form part of six donor
          trees now affixed to the back of the studio building. The final goal
          for the stream was that at $500k raised Maya would shave her head, and
          we were able to reach that goal with $573,004 raised for Alveus over
          the whole stream. Thank you to all the leafers, everyone that donated
          and everyone that watched!
