          Connor has volunteered and worked for many wildlife organizations,
          most notably the American Eagle Foundation and the Alaska Wildlife
          Conservation Center. He has taken his love of conservation and
          technology, combined it, and started helping many conservation
          organizations around the country develop and scale large conservation
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no better place to utilize technology for conservation than
          Alveus. Connor believes Alveus will set the standard for online
          education and drive significant impact and reach for conservation
          education online.

        <p>
          Kayla graduated from college with a degree in biology and a desire to
          see the world. Her travels eventually found her in Alaska, where she
          realized that animal care and conservation was a cause worth staying
          for. Since Alaska, she has traveled to Nepal where she developed an
          unparalleled love and respect for vultures. That interest in birds of
          prey took her to Tennessee and the American Eagle Foundation, where
          training became her primary interest and passion. While she
          specializes in caring for and training birds of prey, Kayla is
          dedicated to and eager to learn about any species she can. She
          believes training is an integral part of animal welfare and is excited
          to build relationships with the Alveus ambassadors to showcase their
          personalities and inspire dedication to their wild counterparts across
          an ever-growing online audience.

          Lindsay graduated college with her Aquatic Biology degree, and her
          Master&apos;s in Conservation of Marine Predators and Coral Reef
          Conservation and Aquaculture. She always knew animals were her
          passion, and loves to travel as much as she can. This brought her to
          American Eagle Foundation where she grew a love for birds of prey.
          Meeting new people, it also took her to Alaska and the Midwest to work
          with a variety of birds. Since moving to Texas, she has grown to love
          all sorts of animals and loves to learn about them and tell anyone who
          will listen about them!

        <p>
          Sruti graduated with a degree in Wildlife Sciences and a Master&apos;s
          in Biology with a focus on Animal Behavior. As a young volunteer at
          her local zoo, Sruti was fortunate to realize her passion for animal
          behavior, conservation, and environmental education. This passion
          translated to jobs all over the world, participating in field research
          and education. That trend continued when she moved to Michigan and
          served as the Mammal Curator for The Creature Conservancy. This
          opportunity channeled her interest in behavior into training, where
          she trained with animals both big and small for fear-free veterinary
          care, educational programs, and mental well-being. To further improve
          her training skills, Sruti studied and worked with K9 Turbo Training
          to obtain her certification in professional dog training. She
          specializes in fear and aggression and loves working with families to
          create a training environment that is supportive, engaging, and fun
          for everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Building relationships with animals, continuing that relationship
          through time and training, and sharing that experience with others
          brings her a lot of joy - she is excited to do that alongside the
          Alveus community!

          Amanda knew from a young age that she wanted to work with animals.
          After graduating with a degree in biology she started her career off
          as a zookeeper at Zoo Atlanta gaining the opportunity to work with a
          wide variety of hoofstock, primate, and carnivore species. Her love
          for educating and inspiring people to learn more about the animals in
          her care and their wild counterparts grew as well as her desire to
          build positive relationships with the animals she cared for. When the
          opportunity arose to work at Alveus, Amanda was beyond excited to be
          part such of an amazing online community united in the same goal of
          promoting conservation of our natural world.
